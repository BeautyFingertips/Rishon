    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <p>SWEDISH OAT OIL<br>Based on our knowledge of baby skin, we wanted to find an ingredient that isn’t just hydrating, but actually improves your baby’s skin barrier and strengthens its resilience against external aggressors. Swedish Oat Oil is an ingredient that does just that.<br>Each drop of this beautiful golden oil has been sustainably extracted from the finest Swedish crops, creating a rich, concentrated ingredient that is exceptionally compatible with baby skin – far more so than other oat ingredients. It has a unique composition of lipids that actually mimic the skin’s own lipids and helps create a ‘second skin’ effect that strengthens your baby’s skin barrier, both on the surface and within the skin, to keep it soft and protected.<br><br><br>Full traceability<br>To ensure the quality, traceability and safety of the raw material is maintained, the husked oats (Avena sativa) are grown in Sweden, by selected growers using sustainable cropping programmes. Sweden is one of the foremost oat-producing countries in the world, with its spring grown oats renowned for their high grain quality. What’s more, farmers are part of an agricultural cooperative, built up through generations of owners. This cooperative contributes to farmers earning a fair profit and helps maintain the vitality of the local farming community.<br><br><br>LIPID LAMELLAR AND NATURAL MOISTURISING FACTOR (NMF) TECHNOLOGY<br>There’s a reason why we compare smooth, soft things to baby skin – it’s unbelievably silky and invites endless cuddles. The silkiness is created by the higher water content in baby skin. However, in contrast, babies have a thinner skin barrier and lower lipid and NMF content that makes it easier for moisture to escape, which can cause uncomfortable dryness. With this in mind, our experts have enhanced Baby O’ with Lipid Lamellar Technology and Natural Moisturising Factor (NMF) Technology – two innovative ingredients that help strengthen your baby’s skin barrier and improve moisture retention, which keeps your baby’s skin silky soft, comfortable and protected.<br><br><br>THE BABY O’ PRODUCT PHILOSOPHY: A ‘LESS IS MORE’ APPROACH<br>We’re as committed to your baby as you are and that’s why we don’t believe in exposing your precious bundle of joy to anything unnecessary. In addition to being 95% natural, Baby O’ is grounded in a ‘less is more’ philosophy. That means no fragrances, harsh ingredients or allergens, and minimal use of preservatives – where possible our products are ‘self-preserving’. Where it is not possible to self-preserve we have used nature-identical preservatives commonly used in food and drinks. All our Baby O’ formulations are formulated without parabens, phenoxyethanol and formaldehyde releasers. Every product is dermatologically and allergy tested and proven safe for sensitive skin.<br><br>All Ingredients<br>AQUA, GLYCERIN, OLEA EUROPAEA FRUIT OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, GLYCERYL STEARATE CITRATE, SODIUM ACRYLATES COPOLYMER, AVENA SATIVA KERNEL OIL, CERA ALBA, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CETEARYL GLUCOSIDE, SORBITAN OLIVATE, HYDROXYACETOPHENONE, LECITHIN, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE</p>
