    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <p>SWEDISH OAT OIL<br>Based on our knowledge of baby skin, we wanted to find an ingredient that isn’t just hydrating, but actually improves your baby’s skin barrier and strengthens its resilience against external aggressors. Swedish Oat Oil does just that.<br><br>Each drop of this beautiful golden oil has been sustainably extracted from the finest Swedish crops, creating a rich, concentrated ingredient that is exceptionally compatible with baby skin – far more so than other oat ingredients. It has a unique composition of lipids that actually mimic the skin’s own lipids and helps create a ‘second skin’ effect that strengthens your baby’s skin barrier, both on the surface and within the skin, to keep it soft and protected.<br><br><br>Full traceability<br><br>To ensure the quality, traceability and safety of the raw material is maintained, the husked oats (Avena sativa) are grown in Sweden, by selected growers using sustainable cropping programmes. Sweden is one of the foremost oat-producing countries in the world, with its spring grown oats renowned for their high grain quality. What’s more, farmers are part of an agricultural cooperative, built up through generations of owners. This cooperative contributes to farmers earning a fair profit and helps maintain the vitality of the local farming community.<br><br><br>THE BABY O’ PRODUCT PHILOSOPHY: A ‘LESS IS MORE’ APPROACH<br><br>We’re as committed to your baby as you are and that’s why we don’t believe in exposing your precious bundle of joy to anything unnecessary. In addition to being 95% natural, Baby O’ is grounded in a ‘less is more’ philosophy. That means no fragrances, harsh ingredients or allergens, and minimal use of preservatives – where possible our products are ‘self-preserving’. Where it is not possible to self-preserve we have used nature-identical preservatives commonly used in food and drinks. All our Baby O’ formulations are formulated without parabens, phenoxyethanol and formaldehyde releasers. Every product is dermatologically and allergy tested and proven safe for sensitive skin.<br><br><br>All Ingredients<br>AQUA, SODIUM METHYL COCOYL TAURATE, LAURYL GLUCOSIDE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, COCO-GLUCOSIDE, GLYCERYL OLEATE, CITRIC ACID, DISODIUM COCOAMPHODIACETATE, POLYQUATERNIUM-67, SODIUM COCOAMPHOACETATE, SODIUM GLUCONATE, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, SODIUM BENZOATE, AVENA SATIVA KERNEL OIL, TOCOPHEROL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE, LECITHIN, ASCORBYL PALMITATE</p>
